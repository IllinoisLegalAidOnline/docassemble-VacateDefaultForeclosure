  Vacate a default judgment of foreclosure
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Vacate a default judgment of foreclosure** Easy Form.

  If a court issued a default judgment putting your property in foreclosure, you can ask the court to vacate by filing a *Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of Foreclosure*. This program helps you complete the motion, as well as other forms you may need.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**vacating a default judgment in a foreclosure case**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/vacating-default-judgment-foreclosure-case).

  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need: 

  * The Judgment of Foreclosure entered against you,
  * The Order of Default,
  * Names and addresses of the other parties,
  * Names and addresses of the other parties' lawyers, and
  * A reason why you missed your court hearing or why the judge entered a default judgment.

  You can find information about dates, other parties, and addresses in the court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 10 to 20 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later.

question: |
  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your *Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of Foreclosure* forms, you must file them with the court. This program does not file your forms for you.
  
  You will also need to send copies of your forms to the other parties in the case.

   **Note:** If you have not filed an Appearance in the foreclosure case, you may need to do that before asking the court to vacate the judgment. You can use ILAO's [**Appearance Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/appearance) to make an appearance to file with the court.

  ${collapse_template(what_fees)}
  
  You can also download instructions at the end of this program. The instructions can guide you through filing your forms and going to court. 
---
template: what_fees
subject: |
  **Will I need to pay any court fees?**
content: |
  If you have already paid to file an appearance in the foreclosure case, you do not need to pay additional court costs to file this motion. You also do not need to pay if you have alrady gotten a fee waiver.

  If you still need to file an Appearance with the court, you can use ILAO's [**Appearance Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/appearance).

  If you would like to ask for a fee waiver, you can use ILAO's [**Fee waiver Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/fee-waiver).

id: default info
continue button field: default_info
question: |
  Default judgment information
subquestion: |
  When you are sued, you have to tell the court if you want to participate in the case. If you don't respond or go to court, the judge can decide the case against you. This is called being "in default." The order against you is called a **default judgment**.
  
  This program will help you make a Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of Foreclosure that asks the judge to undo the default judgment so you can participate in the court case. You must file the motion within 30 days of the judgment. If you file after 30 days, it becomes much harder to undo the judgment.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**vacating a default judgment in a foreclosure case**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/vacating-default-judgment-foreclosure-case).
